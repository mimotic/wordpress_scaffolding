This method of attack, known as a brute force attack, is something that WordPress is acutely susceptible to as, by default, the system doesn’t care how many attempts a user makes to login. It will always let you try again. Enabling login limits will ban the host user from attempting to login again after the specified bad login threshold has been reached.",
